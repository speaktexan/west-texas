I just have one last request from you before we conclude our interview. One of the overarching research questions through the Home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas. As part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief passage which should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s. And since, and since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people standard way of speaking as they tried to track how speed, how speeches in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage out loud? "

I like growing up in the county--, in the country, country. When my chores were done, I advise my, I ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we taped tied a rope to a limb of a sighted forestry and would swing out wide over the brimming swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we have fights with corn cobs or pine cones in the wind to rebuild. We'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I go saw was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at Firestone Tire company. I didn't like city life. And for a long time I go home every chance I got my mom would always cook my favorite foods, fried okra, hoppin John, that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had a lot of good times but going home is not the same. And daddy ma died,  mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving into the country. My oldest child says \"Daddy that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that I know Texas is changing. But I've tried to make sure we don't lose touch with the roots. We may live in a city. I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land and have a sense of place and pride in being Texans. If they lose their ties to the land, the price the program, progress is too high. "
