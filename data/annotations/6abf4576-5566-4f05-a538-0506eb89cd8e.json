I have one last request for you before we conclude our interview. One of the overarching\nresearch questions about the home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas. As part of\nthis program, a linguistic researcher is asking the interview participants to read a brief passage that\nshould only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas created in 1980s.\nAnd since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They use these\nrecordings as samples of people standard way of speaking as they try to track how Texas speech\nvaries over time. Would you be willing to read this passage out loud? [SHIFTING PAPERS] Great, I'm\ngonna hand this over to you and [BUMPS RECORDER] whenever you're ready."

And when I was five, we\nmoved to a farm in near White House, which is [CHUCKLES] Southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in\nthe country. When my chores were done. I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish\nor swim One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we swing out wide over the swimming\nhole and drop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. Uh, in the spring, I'd fly kites.\nAnd on summer nights we catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while, we'd have\nfights with the corncobs or pine cones. In the winter, we build a fire and fireplace and pop popcorn and\nroast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas, and a\nFirestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long time, I'd go home every chance I got. Mama\nwould always cook my favorite foods. Fried okra hopping John, that's rice and black eyed peas, and\npecan pie. We had lots of good times but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama\nsold the farm and moved Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now, instead of here in the city, but\nmy wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country.\nMy oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I'll just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time\nshe said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While\nwe may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a sense of place and take\npride in being Texan. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high.[HANDS PAPER\nBACK]"
