I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I ride my horse, climb trees or hide down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights, we'd would catch butterflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones, in the winter we'll build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at Firestone Tires Store. I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods, fried okra, hoppin john, that's rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had a lot of good times, but going home, it's not the same now. After daddy, died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm, now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe up about city life and talking about moving to the country. My oldest child says \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm\". I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our lives to the land--If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high.\" [PAPER NOISES]  "
