I just have one last request for you before we complete our interview. One of the overarching research questions through the Home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas. As part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief passage. This should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short minute story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s and since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They use these recordings as sample of people's standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage out loud?"

I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to decree to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree in which swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods. fried okra. hoppin john. That's rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on the farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about the city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says, Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose their- lose- if we lose our ties to the land, the price of prog- progress is too high.\n"
