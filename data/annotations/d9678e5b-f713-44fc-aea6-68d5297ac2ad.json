But now that, uh, things have changed, our city has grown so much, we, I feel like it's just so hard and just to get ourselves ou- out and, and about like having to go to work, you got to have make sure you have a car. Uh, the transit is not as, uh, it used to be, you have to wait a long time to - to catch a bus. Uh, so having a car is a necessity to get around. But, uh, other than that, uh, it's still, you know, it's a nice place to be. And [COMMUNITY NAME] a real friendly place and, uh, being a, a [TYPE OF CITY], uh, that's, uh, some advantages we have. Like back then at the [LOCATION IN COMMUNITY], being close to [DIFFERENT COMMUNITY NAME IN DIFFERENT COUNTRY], uh, people were able to cross with no problems at all. They weren't asked, they weren't stopped to see what, where- why they were here. They were free to, uh, just walk over to our city. Now, we- we see a lot of [PHONE NOTIFICATION IN BACKGROUND], of that not happening anymore. We don't go to [DIFFERENT COMMUNITY NAME IN DIFFERENT COUNTRY] anymore because, uh, everything's gotten so bad right now over there. So, we try just to stay in this side of the town. So, that's the only difference. I miss going to the [LOCATION IN COMMUNITY] to go visit family in [DIFFERENT COMMUNITY NAME IN DIFFERENT COUNTRY]. Uh, that's the only difference I see now, you know. Uh, their [LAW ENFORCEMENT NAME] is so, always out there looking to make sure that nobody comes over, so.  "

If you have the time, I just have one last request for you before we conclude our interview. One of the overarching research questions through the Home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas. As part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking the interview participants read a brief passage, which should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few hundred Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking, as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Will you be reading- will you be willing to read a brief passage out loud?  "

I like growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limp of cypress tree. We'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and dropped into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. [ABRUPT BACKGROUND NOISE] Once in a while, we have fights with corn cups or pine cones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods. Fried okra, hopping john, that's rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on the farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says, Daddy, that's crazy, I'd just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land and have a sense of place and take pride in being Texas. If they lose our ties to the land the price of progress is too high. [BACKGROUND NOISE] "
