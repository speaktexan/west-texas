Uh- It kind of created some issues with\nthe infrastructure. The community, because we had a infrastructure for 35,000 people and we\nhad 15 or 20,000 people living here, so there was a glut of housing, and, um- there was, uh-\nprobably not at that point enough people to, uh- keep the- all of the businesses and so forth\nopen, so some things closed, and, uh- real estate market was depressed for- for years after the\nclosure because of the glut of housing and, uh- commercial- commercial buildings. So- It used\nto be a really cheap place to live in some ways because of the, uh- housing costs and, uh- real\nestate prices. Uh- That was probably the biggest difference, biggest change. Uh- It's, uh- kind of\ngrown with the country, it's become- You know, at one time, we were a little more, uh-\nseparated. we had the minority community was pretty much on one side of the- on the- on the,\nuh- north side of town, and the- and the white community was on the South side of town. And\nthat's since changed, and now everything's kind of integrated together. So it's not, uh- separate\nlike it was. We had a- Originally, we had a- a minority high school and a- and a majority high\nschool, and now, we have one high school, so that's probably all a good thing. Uh- And anyway,\nIt's kept kind of- It's kind of grown with the country and changed with the- with the country, as\nfar as, you know things socially and politically in every other way. Uh- In the last, uh- few\nyears, a big change has been with the oil booms and busts when the, uh- oil boom would-\nwould come we would, you know- Money would flow, and everybody was smiling. Everybody\nhad monies. Money was flowing, and then when the bust would hit, everybody was crying and\npoor and- and so it was you know that cycle has been pretty, uh- pretty common over the last\nfew years we've had the boom and bust, uh- going on for quite a while now. And right now\nwe're probably kind of in a semi boom, still- still good. Prices of oil is high, and, uh- wages are\ngood here for the most part. So it's, uh- I think- I think in some ways it's a relatively, uh- uh-\ncomfortable community, as far as- You know, there are- you know, there are some, uh- people\nthat are struggling, but, uh- there's plenty of jobs and wages are actually pretty good here."

Uh- We got some doc in a boxes and popped in\nand kind of changed the format with how medical- medical tr- treatment is- is given but, uh- the\nschool system struggles a little bit, and one of the reasons for that is that, uh- a lot of the better\nstudents tend to try to move to [Neighboring Community 2] or [Neighboring Community]. I'm\nnot really sure the significance of that, but, uh- it seems like we- we have an issue with- uh- at\nthe school systems because some of our more affluent students, uh- are moving to the small\ncommunities around us, and of course, I when I was here, we all went to the Big Spring\nschools, and so I don't completely understand that- that whole concept. Uh- I had my children\nboth went to the public schools here, but, um- I'm not sure that my grandchildren will. They\nboth- My grandchildren here are- are going to a private school, but they're just in, uh- third\ngrade, so it's not a huge big deal, but, uh- anyway, probably right now is the school system\nstruggles a little bit the hospital is struggling a little bit, um- and we don't have the retail. So a\nlot of people have to travel to- to go shop, and if they- you know, if you- if you want to buy a\nsuit, you probably have to drive to [West Texas Community].

And\nI know there were a lot of challenges because I was calling on stores with my wholesale\nfurniture business. I was calling on some of those stores, and COVID created massive changes\nin- in every business. uh- All of the rules that I would live by when we were in retail furniture\nwent away. Uh- The biggest problem with COVID was, uh- transportation. Um- People were\nbringing in containers of furniture from oversea, and at one time, you could bring a container\nover from China for about- the freight would have probably been about two to four thousand\ndollars for the freight. And, uh- during the pandemic, that freight price went to 25,000. So to\nbring a container furniture of back over here from overseas, the freight was, in many cases, was\nmore than the furniture. So the- the process were dramatically increased. The, uh- cost, The\nlanded cost of furniture was so dramatically changed that, uh- it was- it was hard for me to\nrelate because things that- you know prices that I was used to in my retail experience were just,\nuh- not even close. Prices went stupid. And, uh- they've come back down some, but just like\nwe're kind of experienced with this last inflation cycle that we went through, prices go up, that\nthey- The inflation might come down but the process don't seem to go down. Once you get to a\nprice, once the price gets to a certain level, it might not go up again. But it probably isn't gonna\ngo backwards to where it was. Now, it may go back a little, but you know. I know, the cost of\nmaterials if you're building a house just during COVID, It was just crazy. You know, things for\njust furnit- lumber was just crazy. Everything was crazy. And, uh- then, you know, then that\nkind of went away, and now, we've got this inflation thing, and it's kind of- kind of the next big\nproblem. Hopefully, we can get that resolved."

Uh- It's- it's made it to where you have to drive\nto [North Texas Community] or [West Texas Community] or [West Texas Community #5]. Of\ncourse, by having a house in [Coastal Area] we go to [Central Texas Community #2] for\nmedical now quite a bit, and my urologist is now in [Central Texas Community #2]. My\ndermatologist is in [Coastal Area]. I've got a podiatrist in [Central Texas Community]. Uh- And then I also see a gastroenterologist in [North Texas Community]. So you know, when you get\nolder, all you do is go the doctor. But, um- before we would go to- go to those specialties in\n[Town], and now we have to travel. Uh- And I don't- I don't have kids in school, but, uh- it\nseems like the schools have really changed. And I- I think in some ways, they may be\nimproving. I don't know. I hear good things, but, uh-I know they did seem to go through a real\nstruggle there for a while."

I liked growing up in the country. When\nmy chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish- to fish or\nswim. One time, we tied a rope to a limb on a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the\nswimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the\nspring, I'd fly kites. On summer nights, we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs.\nOnce in a while, we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter, we'd build a fire\nin the fireplace, and pop popcorn, and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When\nI was 19, I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long\ntime, I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods: fried okra.\nhoppin John - That's rice and black eyed peas - and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but\ngoing home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd\nrather be living on a farm right now instead of there- here in the city, but my wife and kids don't\nunderstand me when I gripe about my city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest\nchild says: Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time\nshe said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our\nroots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a\nsense of place, and take pride in being Texans. If they lose their- our ties to land, the price of\nprogress is too high."
